2. node_modules/ - Dependency directory (can be regenerated with install command)
3. pnpm-lock.yaml - Alternative package lock file (project uses package-lock.json)
4. .env - Environment variables file (should not be committed to repository)

None

## Optimizations Performed

1. Removed temporary build artifacts
2. Removed redundant package lock file
3. Removed sensitive environment file
4. Removed node_modules which can be regenerated

## Verification

All removed files can be regenerated:
- dist/ - Run `npm run build`
- node_modules/ - Run `npm install`
- .env - Should be created locally by each developer
- pnpm-lock.yaml - Not needed as project uses npm/package-lock.json
